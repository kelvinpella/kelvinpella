Hi, I'm **Kelvin**!

My passion for coding started in 2020 when I built a Python program to automate my workflow in 3D software CATIA.
I shared my experience in this [linkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kelvinpella_i-have-developed-a-simple-python-program-activity-6738407375847362560-9mwR?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACkY1oYBeDbxFilarr27h_UOB4zIFJfVjJA).  

This project sparked my interest in programming, leading me to transition into a career in software development.

I focus on building scalable, efficient, and user-friendly web applications with **React.Js**, **Next.Js**, **Javascript** and **Typescript**, while continuously learning and improving.
